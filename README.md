# P3
This is a collection point for the Papyrological Publishing Platform (P3). 

### Pylon 3 files for viewing
The collection of material for **Pylon 3 (2023)** can now, for convenience, be found [here in the form of a googlespreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UGFvjVt8KOZOfwsZCRbaH-jGoAorzKbmBCmWzv3acCM/edit#gid=187043614). May I please remind you to add any submissions that any of you may receive to the googlespreadsheet. That way we have a clear idea of how many articles we have for the volume. 
- Links to live files **as they appear in HTML** (PDFs also available, but the links are only accessible for signed up gitlab members) for the third volume of Pylon can be found in the folder: [pylon3ready](https://github.com/jcowey/P3/blob/master/pylon/pylon3ready/list.md)
- An announcement with the call for contributions may be viewed on the website of the journal: [see here](https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/pylon/announcement)
- A deadline for submission for a Pylon 3 article should be **May 19, 2023** at the very latest. Even then if an article needs much attention and change it would probably have to be moved to Pylon 4.

### General information

The online journal **Pylon** is made possible by files stored here. In other repositories in [github: P3-processing](https://github.com/hcayless/P3-processing) (_open access_) and in [gitlab: XML files for HTML production](https://gitlab.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/verlag/PapyrologicalPublicationPlatform/-/tree/master/epidoc) (_login required_) there are also files used for various stages of the production.

**Pylon** already has a presence under the [journals produced and supported](https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/pylon/login) (_login required_) by the University Library in Heidelberg.  At present nothing can be clicked or viewed without a login. 

For help with editing sections of the OJS interface for the journal there is a series of youtube videos online, as well as prose, to lead you through the processes. They may be found here: https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/editorial-workflow. See also the [googlespreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bZDLZgtBR_2g4kMSnWHUfl92Pon8Y1nkhvb0yU2BYkc/edit#gid=0) I prepared.
