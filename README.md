### Preparation of Pylon 5
The collection of material for **Pylon 5 (2024)** can now, for convenience, be found [here in the form of a googlespreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UGFvjVt8KOZOfwsZCRbaH-jGoAorzKbmBCmWzv3acCM/edit#gid=292994264)). May I please remind you to add notification of any submissions that any of you may receive to the googlespreadsheet. That way we have a clear idea of how many articles we have for the volume. 

There is now also a folder which contains all the submissions as they are received. These are in .docx format and can be downloaded by anyone. They are available here: [folder in google - LP4tPoJ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DI8wMN1biiEjOBU2fg0vxDxucLP4tPoJ). May I please ask any editors who receive submsissions to upload them to this repository. That way all editors can look at any time at this folder and find the submissions that have come in.

- An announcement with the call for contributions may be viewed on the website of the journal: [see here](https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/pylon/announcement)
- A deadline for submission for a Pylon 5 article should be **May 15, 2024** at the very latest. Even then if an article needs much attention and change it would probably have to be moved to Pylon 6.
- Links to live files **as they appear in HTML** (PDFs also available, but the links are only accessible for signed up gitlab members) for the fifth volume of Pylon can be found in the folder: [pylon5ready](https://github.com/jcowey/P3/blob/master/pylon/pylon5ready/list.md)

### General information

The online journal **Pylon** is made possible by files stored here. In other repositories in [github: P3-processing](https://github.com/hcayless/P3-processing) (_open access_) and in [gitlab: XML files for HTML production](https://gitlab.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/verlag/PapyrologicalPublicationPlatform/-/tree/master/epidoc) (_login required_) there are also files used for various stages of the production.

**Pylon** already has a presence under the [journals produced and supported](https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/pylon/login) (_login required_) by the University Library in Heidelberg.  At present nothing can be clicked or viewed without a login. 

For help with editing sections of the OJS interface for the journal there is a series of youtube videos online, as well as prose, to lead you through the processes. They may be found here: https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/editorial-workflow. See also the [googlespreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bZDLZgtBR_2g4kMSnWHUfl92Pon8Y1nkhvb0yU2BYkc/edit#gid=0) I prepared.
