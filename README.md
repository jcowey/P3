# P3
This is now a collection point for the Papyrological Publishing Platform (P3). 

The online journal **Pylon** is made possible by files stored here. In other repositories in [github: P3-processing](https://github.com/hcayless/P3-processing) and in [gitlab: XML files for HTML production](https://gitlab.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/verlag/PapyrologicalPublicationPlatform/-/tree/master/epidoc) there are also files used for various stages of the production.

**Pylon** already has a presence under the [journals produced and supported](https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/pylon/login) by the University Library in Heidelberg.  At present nothing can be clicked or viewed without a login. 

### Files for viewing
Links to live files (at present **four articles in HTML** versions) for the first volume of Pylon can be found in the folder: [pylon1ready](https://github.com/jcowey/P3/blob/master/pylon/pylon1ready/list.md)

### Miscellaneous
An online journal which offers a model I, personally, like is: https://github.com/i-d-e.

Under https://github.com/i-d-e/ride the volumes are listed. 
 * Within each volume https://github.com/i-d-e/ride/tree/master/issues/issue04
 * one can view each article: https://github.com/i-d-e/ride/tree/master/issues/issue04/welschergast
 * or https://github.com/i-d-e/ride/tree/master/issues/issue09/papyri-info, for which the full tei.xml of the file is visible:
   * https://github.com/i-d-e/ride/blob/master/issues/issue09/papyri-info/papyri-info-tei.xml

Also very nicely done is **Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy**: https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198749516.001.0001
