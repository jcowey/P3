# P3
This is now a collection point for the Papyrological Publishing Platform (P3). The online journal Pylon is made possible by files stored here. In other repositories in [github: P3-processing](https://github.com/hcayless/P3-processing) and in [gitlab: XML files for HTML production](https://gitlab.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/verlag/PapyrologicalPublicationPlatform/-/tree/master/epidoc) there are also files used for various stages of the production.

### Files for viewing
Links to live files for the first volume of Pylon can be found in the folder: [pylon1ready](https://github.com/jcowey/P3/blob/master/pylon/pylon1ready/list.md)
