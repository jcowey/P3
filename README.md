# P3
This is now a collection point for the Papyrological Publishing Platform (P3). Files and mock ups may be found here.

Live files for the first volume of Pylon can be found in the folder: [pylon1ready](https://github.com/jcowey/P3/blob/master/pylon/pylon1ready/list.md)
An online journal which offers a model I, personally, like is: https://github.com/i-d-e.

Under https://github.com/i-d-e/ride the volumes are listed. 
 * Within each volume https://github.com/i-d-e/ride/tree/issues/04
 * one can view each article: https://github.com/i-d-e/ride/tree/issues/04/welschergast
 * or https://github.com/i-d-e/ride/tree/issues/09/papyri-info, for which the full tei.xml of the file is visible:
