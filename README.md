# P3
This is now a collection point for the Papyrological Publishing Platform (P3). 

The collection of material for **Pylon 2 (2022)** can now, for convenience, be found [here in the form of a googlespreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UGFvjVt8KOZOfwsZCRbaH-jGoAorzKbmBCmWzv3acCM/edit#gid=0).

The online journal **Pylon** is made possible by files stored here. In other repositories in [github: P3-processing](https://github.com/hcayless/P3-processing) (_open access_) and in [gitlab: XML files for HTML production](https://gitlab.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/verlag/PapyrologicalPublicationPlatform/-/tree/master/epidoc) (_login required_) there are also files used for various stages of the production.

**Pylon** already has a presence under the [journals produced and supported](https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/pylon/login) (_login required_) by the University Library in Heidelberg.  At present nothing can be clicked or viewed without a login. 

For help with editing sections of the OJS interface for the journal there is a series of youtube videos online, as well as prose, to lead you through the processes. They may be found here: https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/editorial-workflow. See also the [googlespreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bZDLZgtBR_2g4kMSnWHUfl92Pon8Y1nkhvb0yU2BYkc/edit#gid=0) I prepared.

For versioning see: https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.2/en/production-publication. The last section in that file seems to cover what we need. See also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcSQiDj2-zw
