# Templates for Pylon article mark up

Once the article has been reached the stage that the editorial board is happy with it and the author is likewise happy, Pylon asks the author to provide some extra mark up to the article, so that it can be processed into XML format by https://github.com/hcayless/P3-processing. The XML file can then be uploaded to the OJS XML repository, from where it is used as the basis for the automatic production of the HTML and PDF version of the article. 

Below templates for this mark up are provided as well as a sample of such mark up.
