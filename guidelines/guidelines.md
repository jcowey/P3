# Guidelines for submission of articles to Pylon

## Fonts and layout

- Make sure you use Unicode fonts throughout. You may use any Unicode font for the Greek, Coptic, Latin texts (later Demotic, Arabic). As all articles will be transformed to XML and then to HTML / PDF, a standard house style will be applied.
- You may format your paragraphs and sections as you like. Please present text editions in the standard fashion (see example below). These will also be formatted in the house style anyway.

## Citing sources

### Papyri, ostraca, tablets

- Papyrological texts are to be cited according to the abbreviations of [http://papyri.info/docs/checklist](http://papyri.info/docs/checklist).
- Citations should follow this pattern: P.Oxy. 1 133.3; BGU 1 118 Col. 2.9-10; P.Eirene 3 17 V 2.
  - Comma can be used instead of a dot: P.Oxy. 1 133,3, if that is the tradition in a language 	other than English.
  - Berichtigungsliste: BL 3.235
  - Please add a link to any cited texts, where the reader would welcome the opportunity to be 	linked through the the relevant passage in [papyri.info](papyri.info).
