# Guidelines for submission of articles to Pylon

## Fonts and layout

- Make sure you use Unicode fonts throughout. You may use any Unicode font for the Greek, Coptic, Latin texts (later Demotic, Arabic). As all articles will be transformed to XML and then to HTML / PDF, a standard house style will be applied.
- You may format your paragraphs and sections as you like. Please present text editions in the standard fashion (see example below). These will also be formatted in the house style anyway.

## Citing sources

### Papyri, ostraca, tablets

- Papyrological texts are to be cited according to the abbreviations of [http://papyri.info/docs/checklist](http://papyri.info/docs/checklist).
- Citations should follow this pattern: **P.Oxy. 1 133.3**; **BGU 1 118 Col. 2.9-10**; **P.Eirene 3 17 V 2**.
  - Comma can be used instead of a dot: **P.Oxy. 1 133,3**, if that is the tradition in a language 	other than English.
  - Berichtigungsliste: **BL 3.235**
  - Please add a link to any cited texts, where the reader would welcome the opportunity to be 	linked through the the relevant passage in [papyri.info](https://papyri.info).
- Use BC/AD or BCE/CE with dates, but these specifications should only be included if necessary and used consistently. If all dates are BC or AD this can be made clear in a footnote. In referring to centuries use Arabic numerals and the shortest possible abbreviation for the word century, e.g. 7th c. or 7. Jh. (for citation of sources). In full prose, of course, spelling out the word “century” is perfectly acceptable)
- When giving the date of a papyrus for citation of sources, the day and month should be omitted, unless they are of importance
- For provenance in the citation of sources, unless it is necessary to be more precise, the nome or city should be given preference (no more than one place name, unless essential): **P.Oxy. 3 473 (138-160, Naucratis)**; **SB 28 17090 (116, Krokodilo)**; **P.Fay. 110 (94, Arsinoites)**

### Inscriptions

- For Greek inscriptions use: 
  - [https://www.aiegl.org/grepiabbr.html](https://www.aiegl.org/grepiabbr.html)
- For Latin inscriptions make use of:
  - [https://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/hilfe/liste/corpora](https://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/hilfe/liste/corpora)
  - [http://db.edcs.eu/epigr/hinweise/abkuerz.html](http://db.edcs.eu/epigr/hinweise/abkuerz.html)
  - [https://www.antiquite.ens.fr/IMG/file/pdf_guide_epi/abreviations_guide.pdf](https://www.antiquite.ens.fr/IMG/file/pdf_guide_epi/abreviations_guide.pdf)

### Trismegistos

When citing Trismegistos, use their standards:

[https://www.trismegistos.org/about_how_to_cite.php](https://www.trismegistos.org/about_how_to_cite.php) (under the column „Human readable“)
- TM
- TM Geo
- TM Nam
- etc

### Authors

- For classical authors, use the abbreviations of [LSJ](https://www.stoa.org/abbreviations.html) and [OLD](https://www.oxfordscholarlyeditions.com/page/abbreviations). Books, chapters or sections should be indicated with Arabic numbers separated by dots without spacing, e.g. **Plb. 2.69.9**.
- For the Greek patristic authors, use the abbreviations of Lampe’s Patristic Greek Lexicon.

### Editions

- Make sure you have permission to publish the papyri you are editing.
- No lunate sigmas. Use mid and end sigmas throughout.
- Feel free to use arrows to indicate fibre direction, but it is not mandatory. 
- Do not capitalize the first word of each sentence in the papyrus text. Capitals only for proper names of people (includes Αὐτοκράτωρ Καῖσαρ and the honorary titles and month names) and places.
- Before conversion to XML Greek, Coptic, Latin texts will be marked up in Leiden+. The apparatus will be done inline as in [papyri.info](https://papyri.info). This means that there will be no place for representations of how abbreviations are made on the original (no raised letters or glyphs such as are to be found in IFAOGrec Unicode). Ancient diacritical marks such as apostrophes or diaereses should be included. Please use Latin abbreviations, such as l. or ex corr.
- In all editions of texts on papyrus, ostraca or whatever text bearing material ALL abbreviated words will be expanded as fully as possible. E.g. when dealing with drachmas: NOT (δρ.) but: ((δραχμαὶ)) ((δραχμὰς)) and when the case is not known ((δραχμ- )).

### Bibliography

It is perfectly acceptable to submit articles without a bibliography, if, however, the author chooses to supply a bibliography:
Our preferred style is 

- author(s) surname, abbreviated forename(s), (date of publication), title, journal, volume number, pages
- author(s) surname, abbreviated forename(s), (date of publication), title, place of publication

Authors will be asked to provide the biblio ids from http://papyri.info/bibliosearch as links. 
(if they cannot be found, then they will be created and supplied before the submission is converted). Thus if it is easier to use a different way of presenting bibliography that is also perfectly in order. The main point is that biblio ids are searched for and supplied at the earliest possible 
moment.

Alongside the biblio ids whenever any stable identifiers (e.g. jstor) or DOIs are known to you (e.g. CdE) we would welcome them (you do not have to go looking for them).
