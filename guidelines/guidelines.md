# Guidelines for submission of articles to Pylon

## Fonts and layout

- Make sure you use Unicode fonts throughout. You may use any Unicode font for the Greek, Coptic, Latin texts (later Demotic, Arabic). As all articles will be transformed to XML and then to HTML / PDF, a standard house style will be applied.
- You may format your paragraphs and sections as you like. Please present text editions in the standard fashion (see example below). These will also be formatted in the house style anyway.

## Citing sources

### Papyri, ostraca, tablets

- Papyrological texts are to be cited according to the abbreviations of [http://papyri.info/docs/checklist](http://papyri.info/docs/checklist).
- Citations should follow this pattern: **P.Oxy. 1 133.3**; **BGU 1 118 Col. 2.9-10**; **P.Eirene 3 17 V 2**.
  - Comma can be used instead of a dot: **P.Oxy. 1 133,3**, if that is the tradition in a language 	other than English.
  - Berichtigungsliste: **BL 3.235**
  - Please add a link to any cited texts, where the reader would welcome the opportunity to be 	linked through the the relevant passage in [papyri.info](https://papyri.info).
- Use BC/AD or BCE/CE with dates, but these specifications should only be included if necessary and used consistently. If all dates are BC or AD this can be made clear in a footnote. In referring to centuries use Arabic numerals and the shortest possible abbreviation for the word century, e.g. 7th c. or 7. Jh. (for citation of sources). In full prose, of course, spelling out the word “century” is perfectly acceptable)
- When giving the date of a papyrus for citation of sources, the day and month should be omitted, unless they are of importance
- For provenance in the citation of sources, unless it is necessary to be more precise, the nome or city should be given preference (no more than one place name, unless essential): **P.Oxy. 3 473 (138-160, Naucratis)**; **SB 28 17090 (116, Krokodilo)**; **P.Fay. 110 (94, Arsinoites)**
