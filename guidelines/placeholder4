# Guidelines for submission of articles to Pylon

## Fonts and layout

- Make sure you use Unicode fonts throughout. You may use any Unicode font for the Greek, Coptic, Latin texts (later Demotic, Arabic). As all articles will be transformed to XML and then to HTML / PDF, a standard house style will be applied.
- You may format your paragraphs and sections as you like. Please present text editions in the standard fashion (see example below). These will also be formatted in the house style anyway.

## Citing sources

### Papyri, ostraca, tablets

- Papyrological texts are to be cited according to the abbreviations of [http://papyri.info/docs/checklist](http://papyri.info/docs/checklist).
