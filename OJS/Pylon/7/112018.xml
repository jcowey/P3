               <head>Introduction</head>
               <p xml:id="p1">In a recent article, Serena Perrone has mined the Homeric papyri from Karanis for evidence about Greek literary culture there, employing an interdisciplinary approach whose contextualization of the texts incorporates legacy data from the University of Michigan’s 1924–1935 excavations at the village. Using the dig’s invaluable record of excavated objects, Perrone surveys the distribution of Homeric papyri by their stratigraphic level to reassess what we can learn about readership in an ancient village. She notes repeatedly the archaeological caveats associated with the excavation’s methodology as well as how tenuous the attempts to connect individual fragmentary texts with specific readers or libraries have proven.<note xml:id="ftn1" place="foot" n="1">
                     <p> E.g., <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96419">Perrone 2022</ref>: 37, 41–42, 45.</p>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p xml:id="p2">This article supplements Perrone’s findings by bringing additional archival and archaeological data to bear on the contextualization of the Homer papyri from Karanis – both purchased and excavated. The latter work proceeds in parallel with traditional papyrological and palaeographical (re)analyses of the texts, but it is nonetheless conducted independently of them, in the interest of methodological control. As Perrone rightly notes, the levels recorded by the Michigan excavators are not stratigraphic levels in the real archaeological sense,<note xml:id="ftn2" place="foot" n="2">
                     <p>
                        <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96419">Perrone 2022</ref>: 41.</p>
                  </note> and as I demonstrate repeatedly, it is rarely the case that the archaeological and papyrological data map neatly onto one another. The addition of archival photography, field reports, and (on occasion) ceramic analyses all serve to decenter papyri somewhat from the archaeological analysis of Karanis. Perrone’s caution about the kinds of conclusions that can be sustained by an interdisciplinary approach are well placed,<note xml:id="ftn3" place="foot" n="3">
                     <p> E.g., <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96419">Perrone 2022</ref>: 55–56.</p>
                  </note> and I would add to the chorus by noting that, the better we understand the bigger picture revealed by archaeological data, the more problematic the place of the papyri within it becomes. </p>
               <p xml:id="p3">Of the ca. 2,000 Homeric papyri in the Leuven Database of Ancient Books (LDAB), thirty have ‘Karanis’ as their stated provenance.<note xml:id="ftn4" place="foot" n="4">
                     <p> For the first figure, cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96419">Perrone 2022</ref>: 37, n. 1. The latter was retrieved via a search in LDAB for ‘Homer’ in the field ‘Ancient Author &amp;amp; Work’ and ‘Karanis’ in the field ‘Provenance’, last accessed on 1 July 2025. The LDAB is now a component of Trismegistos: <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96068">Depauw and Gheldof 2014</ref>. </p>
                  </note> That figure includes three items of Homerica – one a lexicon,<note xml:id="ftn5" place="foot" n="5">

                  </note> another a commentary,<note xml:id="ftn6" place="foot" n="6">

                  </note> – as well as two books which have been located there on rather dubious grounds. One was purchased by Bernard P. Grenfell and Francis W. Kelsey in February/March 1920, and neither archival material in Ann Arbor nor the publications that discuss it mention Karanis.<note xml:id="ftn8" place="foot" n="8">
                     <p> So also <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96419">Perrone 2022</ref>: 46 n. 51. The papyrus is P.Mich. inv. 15 + 15bis (<ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/60685">TM 60685</ref>), which belongs to the Michigan collection’s founding purchase of 534 papyri: see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95801">Boak 1922</ref>: 38, <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/51004">Shelmerdine 1975</ref>: 21–22, no. 3, and <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/11613">Schwendner 1988</ref>: 13, no. 5, none of which mention Karanis. The acquisition report prepared for the collection by Arthur S. Hunt is similarly silent as regards provenance. On Kelsey and Grenfell’s collaboration, see Todd Hickey’s forthcoming introductions to P.Mich.Cent. and P.Lond. 8.</p>
                  </note> The other is a codex fragment that Charles Brasch donated to the Tūhura Otago Museum in Dunedin, New Zealand (<ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/60878">TM 60878</ref>, <ref target="#fig1">Figure 1</ref> and <ref target="#fig2">Figure 2</ref>). In its <emph rend="italics">editio princeps</emph>, Whitehorne suggested an attribution to Karanis on the following grounds:</p>
               <quote type="secondary">
                  <p>Brasch spent three seasons in Egypt in 1932–1935, working ‘as a kind of unpaid cadet’ on the Egypt Exploration Society excavations at Tell el Amarna, at the same time as C. H. Roberts, his Oxford contemporary, was engaged as a papyrologist with the University of Michigan expedition at Karanis. There is no information on the provenance of the texts published here, but Brasch visited Roberts at Karanis several times, and the pieces may have come from there since the lessee in (3), a landlease, comes from Arsinoe.<note xml:id="ftn9" place="foot" n="9">

               <p>The information in the anecdote is an insufficient basis for even a tentative assignment of provenance. If one excludes these as well as the three items of Homerica, a census of the Homer papyri from Karanis more accurately begins with the following twenty-five individual copies of the <emph rend="italics">Iliad</emph> and <emph rend="italics">Odyssey</emph>.<note xml:id="ftn10" place="foot" n="10">

               <p xml:id="p4">The remarks in the preceding table under ‘Acquisition’ are sufficient to demonstrate the various books’ origins in Karanis. The final twenty items (Nos. 6–25) were all excavated by the University of Michigan (1924–1935), and their provenience is accordingly documented with a field number. Those Michigan papyri fall into two groups. Eleven of them (Nos. 6–16) were uncovered during the third season of work (i.e., 1926/7) in the neighborhood dubbed ‘Area G’ by the excavators.<note xml:id="ftn11" place="foot" n="11">

                  </note> The others (Nos. 17–25) came to light in other seasons and from other locations across the <emph rend="italics">kôm</emph>. All but one derive from bookrolls with dates between the first and third centuries CE; the sole codex fragment is the chronological outlier, as discussed further below. For the other five texts (Nos. 1–5), the historical record also confirms a provenance in Karanis, which is remarkable inasmuch as four of them were acquired by purchase on the Egyptian antiquities market. The documentation in these cases may not always rise to the level of an archaeological provenience, but it is nonetheless helpful: for purchased papyri, such information was not typically transmitted or preserved. </p>

They were both part of the large lot of papyri Edgar Goodspeed purchased in October 1897 from a dealer in Asiut, via the Rev. John R. Alexander. Alexander subsequently informed Goodspeed that these papyri all originated in Karanis, from different houses.<note xml:id="ftn13" place="foot" n="13">
                        <p> “(1) The papyri were found in the Faiyum at a town called Washim. (2) They were found by people digging in the heaps or ‘tells’ of dirt and rubbish at the edge of the town. As they dug down they found walls of houses standing in position. In the rooms of these houses or some of them they found the papyri – some were in sacks, others in piles in corners, etc. (3) The pieces are all from that one town but probably not all from the same old ruin – but from different houses.” J. R. Alexander to E. J. Goodspeed, 14 March 1898, reproduced by <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96084">Hickey and Keenan 2021</ref>: 17, quoting a February 1973 transcription by R. W.

                  <p xml:id="p7">Comparison to that famous example of a formal round is generous. Although phi often violates bilinearity (while rho and iota do not), the script of Goodspeed’s papyrus is squatter and its variation between broad (alpha, lambda, nu, omega, tau, pi), square (omicron, theta, eta, sigma), and narrow letters (gamma, rho, iota) is far more pronounced. The lower extremities of many letters end in a serif-like blot, as though the scribe let the pen rest momentarily. In its general appearance, the capitals aspire to the rounded majuscule type, but their execution is quite stiff and imperfect. It is an early hand, and a date in the first century is preferable; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/ddbdp/p.oxy;2;246">P.Oxy. 2 246</ref> (66); <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/61012">PSI 1 11</ref> (middle I).<note xml:id="ftn16" place="foot" n="16">

                     </note> The decorative aspects of the palaeography might even anticipate the tendencies of another type of formal round, namely, the Alexandrian majuscule (for an early example, see e.g., <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/63524">P.Oxy. 27 2469</ref>, II). As in that type, the script of Goodspeed’s papyrus includes marked ‘ripiegamenti a ricciolo’ of alpha and especially delta, and the curvature of lambda and chi is also pronounced.<note xml:id="ftn17" place="foot" n="17">

               <p xml:id="p9">During the first two excavation seasons, the Michigan team had focused on several regions of Kom Aushim that it identified by the letters A through F.<note xml:id="ftn20" place="foot" n="20">
                     <p> See <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95948">Boak and Peterson 1931</ref>: 3–4, and (for an illustration) Plan 1.</p>
                  </note> In the third season (i.e., 1926/7), however, it broke new ground in ‘Area G’, on the western side of the <emph rend="italics">kôm</emph>.<note xml:id="ftn21" place="foot" n="21">
                     <p> The precise location of Area G remains unknown: for a description, see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95948">Boak and Peterson 1931</ref>: 7–8. Cornelia Römer has argued that, in light of the size of the structures and the tendency of the Fayum wind to blow from the northwest, Area G was a prosperous neighborhood (P.Cair.Mich. 3, p. x–xi).</p>
                  </note> The decision to do so came at an important turning point in the history of the dig. In the autumn of 1926, surveys and maps from the first two seasons of work remained incomplete, and the excavation as a whole had become imperilled by administrative and financial dysfunction. James Starkey was replaced as field director by Enoch Peterson, who immediately decided to focus the excavation’s energies on a new part of the <emph rend="italics">kôm</emph> he hoped would prove fruitful. Peterson perhaps underestimated the enormity of the task: so great was the quantity of fill in Area G that not every structure could be cleared to its foundation. As a consequence, the maps and plans from this third season were also left incomplete: the best we can do is the hand-drawn <ref target="#fig4">Figure 4</ref>, in which the intersecting streets BS1 and BS2 divide the neighborhood roughly into quadrants. Much about Area G’s archaeology remains unclear.<note xml:id="ftn22" place="foot" n="22">
                     <p> On the background to the third season, see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96751">Sampson 2023</ref>: 457–459.</p>

               </p>
               <p xml:id="p10">The eleven Homeric papyri discussed below are a small fraction of the bounty of texts uncovered in Area G. These included, most notably, portions of the so-called ‘archive’ of Sokrates the tax-collector, which was treated by Peter van Minnen in a study that has proven foundational to papyrology’s interdisciplinary turn.<note xml:id="ftn23" place="foot" n="23">
                     <p>
                        <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/64415">van Minnen 1994</ref>, building upon <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/61857">Strassi Zaccaria 1991</ref>: 245–262. See also <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/70531">Strassi 2001 </ref>: 1215–1228.</p>
                  </note> But despite Sokrates’ notoriety (and, indeed, my own interdisciplinary aspirations), I resist the temptation blindly to assign material from Area G to an archive, and would hesitate even to posit a unified archive at all. Archaeology does not provide a reliable indication of the papyri’s deposit(s), and the extent to which the archaeological record in Area G has been compromised limits the kinds of conclusions one might draw. I have elsewhere demonstrated, for example, that already by 1891 this neighborhood was being disturbed and was yielding papyri to the Egyptian antiquities market.<note xml:id="ftn24" place="foot" n="24">

                  </note> The distribution and contents of Area G’s Homer papyri also prompt circumspection: not only does one find multiple copies of several of the <emph rend="italics">Iliad</emph>’s books, but these fragmentary books are also scattered across the neighborhood. It would be overly speculative to assign them to particular individuals or libraries, in whole or in part.<note xml:id="ftn25" place="foot" n="25">

                  </p>
                  <p xml:id="p12">The field number assigned to the papyrus by the dig’s record of objects (26-B7H-H) indicates the season of excavation (1926/7) as well as the layer, structure, and internal subdivision (House 7, from the ‘B’ layer, Room H). The final element in the field number itemizes the finds within a subdivision: H, in this case, indicates the eighth item recorded from Room H. House B7 is located on the eastern side of the southeastern quadrant of Area G (see <ref target="#fig4">Figure 4</ref>).</p>
                  <p xml:id="p13">Although House B7 warrants mention in the excavation’s architectural report solely for the white plaster pointing of its bricks and its large, bricked-over oven,<note xml:id="ftn29" place="foot" n="29">
                        <p> For the plaster pointing, see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95948">Boak and Peterson 1931</ref>: 29; for the oven, see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95948">Boak and Peterson 1931</ref>: 36–37, Fig. 54. </p>
                     </note> closer examination of the dig’s legacy data adds considerably to the picture. Captions to archival photographs from the excavation detail various subdivisions of the structure, which in aggregate clarify aspects of its layout. <ref target="#fig5">Figure 5</ref>, for example, depicts the southern entrance, via Passageway BS6: the aforementioned white plaster pointing is visible on the bricks on the left side of the image.<note xml:id="ftn30" place="foot" n="30">
                        <p> Access to House B7 could also be gained from the north, as the caption to 5.2380 implies: “View looking southwest over portions of B3, 4 and entrance to B7.”</p>
                     </note> The first room within was designated B7A, a corridor from which one accessed a staircase B7C.<note xml:id="ftn31" place="foot" n="31">
                         <p> See <ref target="#fig6">Figure 6</ref>. The designation of these two subdivisions as a corridor and staircase, respectively, does not occur in the Kelsey Museum’s photographic archive, but in the handwritten caption to photograph 5.2289 in an archival folder created by Sam Yeivin: “Impression of wooden threshold beam between corridor in h. B7A &amp;amp; stairway B7C.” See Folder 7, Box 17, Karanis Excavation Records, Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, University of Michigan.</p>
                     </note> <ref target="#fig6">Figure 6</ref>, which indicates that this staircase led upward, testifies that the home had a second story. <ref target="#fig7">Figure 7</ref> presents a view of the southern exterior wall, taken from Passage BS7, which ran east/west outside the front door. Five wooden beam-ends are visible, which the caption specifies are situated at floor level, between Rooms B7D and B7G.<note xml:id="ftn32" place="foot" n="32">
                        <p> Caption to 5.2484: “Passageway, BS7, showing the wooden beam ends in the western wall of B7D at floor level between B7D and G.” We interpret the caption’s reference to the B7D’s ‘western’ wall as an error for ‘southern’, since Passageway BS7 (from which the photograph was taken) bordered House B7 to the south.</p>
                     </note> Like Corridor B7A, one concludes that these rooms were situated along the house’s southern wall. </p>

B10E, we may conclude, was the subdivision of B10 to the immediate west of that chamber. </p>

Nonetheless, despite their richness, the preceding analyses are insufficient to determine the precise location of Room B7H – the Homeric papyrus’ findspot. My hypothesis is that B7H was adjacent to (or a further subdivision of) Room B7G in the structure’s southwestern corner, but that hypothesis is grounded chiefly in the fact that texts were excavated in both B7G and B7H and that alphabetical order is compatible with (but not definitively constitutive of) proximity. </p>

                     </note> Although the papyri share a single field number, it is uncertain whether they were all uncovered together or whether they were grouped together in the course of recording, for the sake of convenience. The latter practice is typical for contexts in which large numbers of papyri were discovered (e.g., 26-B17F-A, 24-5006-E<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>-A), but the field numbers beginning 26-BS1 are unusual inasmuch as they lack any further subdivision (as would be expected in a structure) – Street BS1 is a major thoroughfare in Area G! The field numbers for this context, rather, appear simply to itemize the finds, and every papyrus has the field number 26-BS1-PI. The hypothesis that a single cache was uncovered in a particular location on the street is further weakened by the fact that some literary fragments from this context join with others found in nearby structures, providing clear evidence that, as has been documented elsewhere, the papyri in Area G have ‘wandered’ and that the circumstances of their deposition are indeterminable.<note xml:id="ftn44" place="foot" n="44">

Photographic testimony is sufficient to reconstruct a few aspects of the building’s layout: the architectural report’s reference to a <emph rend="italics">pair</emph> of ovens means that Oven B25M is visible in the lower right corner of the eastward-facing <ref target="#fig21">Figure 21</ref> – i.e., along the structure’s western wall. In that photograph, the oven appears also to contain ceramics, which is consistent with the testimony of <ref target="#fig19">Figure 19</ref>. The second oven mentioned by the architectural report also lies along the western wall at the bottom of <ref target="#fig21">Figure 21</ref>, to the north of the first. The position of Oven B25M on the building’s west side means that the view of B25M, B25L, and B25T in <ref target="#fig18">Figure 18</ref> is westward-facing and that B25L was situated to the south of B25M. Comparison with <ref target="#fig19">Figure 19</ref>, which reveals that the Oven B25M was a subdivision of a larger chamber, suffices to conclude that B25T is that larger chamber. In the southward-oriented <ref target="#fig20">Figure 20</ref>, B25T is therefore the chamber obscured by shade on the right side of the frame: only the eastern extremity of B25M is visible at the right edge. One of the Homeric papyri was uncovered in B25T (<ref target="#no11">No. 11</ref>), and although the caption to <ref target="#fig20">Figure 20</ref> also mentions Rooms B25A and B25R (where the other two papyri were found), the position of these subdivisions within the larger structure cannot be determined with any precision.</p>

The fact that B25 was covered by several meters of sebakh – especially, as <ref target="#fig17">Figure 17</ref> indicates, along the western wall where this chamber was located – makes that annotation less surprising, and undermines the possibility of a clear relationship between text and context. One ought not to assert that the papyrus was found in the bin. Its script is an elegant formal round, the small sample size of which makes it somewhat difficult to determine whether it is an example of biblical or rounded majuscule. Despite the horizontal bar of alpha, its bilinear rho, and the presence of serifs on alpha at both apex and base of the right diagonal (all of which would suggest the latter), Römer’s <emph rend="italics">editio princeps</emph> is correct to emphasize the penstrokes’ elegant variation of shading in preferring the former. A date in the later second or early third century therefore seems appropriate: I would compare <ref target="http://papyri.info/dclp/59391">P.Oxy. 18 2169</ref> (later II).<note xml:id="ftn49" place="foot" n="49">

                     </note> <ref target="#fig25">Figure 25</ref> presents a south-facing view of over the southern complex of B12: the tall walls in the center of the frame correspond to the north and west walls of B55 as illustrated on <ref target="#fig4">Figure 4</ref>, which permits the inference that the picture was taken from Courtyard B12L.<note xml:id="ftn53" place="foot" n="53">
                         <p> See <ref target="#fig25">Figure 25</ref>. These details, which are sufficient to locate B12M in the southern complex of B12, are owed to the handwritten caption to 5.2082 in an archival folder created by Sam Yeivin: “House B12M, view looking SE, showing also the N. &amp;amp; W. walls of h. B55 in middle background. In far background – cultivation.” See Folder 7, Box 17, Karanis Excavation Records, Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, University of Michigan.</p>
                     </note> The excavation’s record of objects documents several finds from Rooms B12M and B12R, both of which I presume belonged to the south complex – though B12M may well have been a subdivision of Courtyard B12L. Given the reference to northern walls in the caption to <ref target="#fig26">Figure 26</ref>, I hypothesize that the vaulted underground rooms of B12 that are visible in the photograph were also located in the southern complex.<note xml:id="ftn54" place="foot" n="54">
                         <p> See <ref target="#fig26">Figure 26</ref>. We suggest that the square entranceway at the top of the image is the same one visible in the bottom of <ref target="#fig25">Figure 25</ref>.</p>
                     </note> Several other texts dating to the second and third centuries were uncovered in Courtyard B12L, but to date only a few have been published.<note xml:id="ftn55" place="foot" n="55">

                  <p xml:id="p29">The first of the Homeric papyri from Courtyard B12L is <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/957670">P.Cair.Mich. 3 2</ref>, written in rounded capitals of an informal but decorated type. Lambda, hypsilon, and mu are upright, while nu and delta are wide, as is omega, whose middle element reclines slightly. The upper arm of kappa is both broad and nearly horizontal, thereby hazarding confusion with eta. The bubble of alpha is small and the tail gently curved, while delta has a pronounced cap and a curved left diagonal. Bilinearity is observed except for the tail of phi and a somewhat shallower right hasta of eta. Cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/63359">BKT 9 10</ref> (II); <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/62613">P.Oxy. 3 454</ref> (later II). Courtyard B12L also yielded two fragments of <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/957671">P.Cair.Mich. 3 4</ref>.<note xml:id="ftn56" place="foot" n="56">
                        <p> A third fragment of this papyrus has the field number 26-B2W-C: it was found in B2, a house on the north side of Street BS1, opposite House B12. For the layout of B2’s underground chambers, see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95948">Boak and Peterson 1931</ref>: Plan IIIA, and the general discussion of pp. 20–23. The wandering of <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/957671">P.Cair.Mich. 3 4</ref>’s fragments is consistent with the evidence that this part of Area G had been disturbed already by 1891. <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/59973">P.Cair.Mich. 2 10 + P.Lond.Lit. 166</ref> and <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/59438">P.Cair.Mich. 2 11 + P.Lond.Lit. 58</ref> originate from the same roll, a portion of which was excavated and assigned the field number 26-B12L-A, while the other was part of the lot acquired from the Rev. Greville John Chester on 2 February 1891. See <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96751">Sampson 2023</ref>: 451–456.</p>
                     </note>  This roll’s script is written in bilinear upright capitals. The letters’ modulus is square but the type is informal, with adornment of the apices of delta and alpha as well as on the hasta of kappa. Its alpha is angular, while the hastae of pi, nu, eta curve gently. The central element of omega is shallow and leans backward slightly. Of extant letters, only the hasta of rho breaches bilinearity. A second-century date is appropriate: cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/10801">P.Fay. 21</ref> (134). </p>

                  <p xml:id="p32">As was noted, two Homeric papyri were excavated in House B9: <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/957669">P.Cair.Mich. 3 1</ref> (26-B9S-E) and <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/957672">P.Cair.Mich. 3 5</ref> (26-B9Y-A). The script of the former is round and squat, upright but informal: its phi is disproportionately large; delta is flattened, with a wide base; serifs adorn the extremities of tau, kappa, and upsilon; and epsilon has a high middle bar. I seem to discern a high point after the verb in the third line. The poor state of preservation and the small sample size inhibits comparison, but it is not unlike <ref target="https://doi.org/10.25446/oxford.21185536">P.Oxy. 80 5234</ref> (II). The other papyrus is <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/957672">P.Cair.Mich. 3 5</ref>, whose upright rounded decorated capitals are akin to the script of <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/957670">P.Cair.Mich. 3 2</ref>, but more decorated and less regularly sized and spaced. With the exception of phi, the script of <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/957672">P.Cair.Mich. 3 5</ref> is bilinear, though the letters’ modulus is not consistently square: some letters are narrow (e.g., hypsilon, alpha), while others are wide (e.g., nu, pi, kappa); some are tall (e.g., phi and beta), while others are comparatively squat (e.g., delta and sigma), as though the notional lines establishing bilinearity were inconsistently spaced. Similarly, sometimes the letters are packed tightly along the horizontal (i.1–5) and in other places more generously separated (i.6–10). </p>

                  <p xml:id="p33">The final nine items (Nos. 17–25) were excavated elsewhere at Kom Aushim by the Michigan team. Little can be said regarding the first two. P.Mich. inv. 2755 (<ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/60343">TM 60343</ref>) and P.Mich. inv. 2764 (<ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/60688">TM 60688</ref>) share the field number 24-X-west side, the imprecision of which designation implies that they were ‘surface finds’ made during the initial 1924/5 season. <emph rend="italics">Implies</emph> is the key word: the records of the first season are poorer than those of later years, and testimony from the field suggests that the dig’s methodology was being developed on the fly by its four principals and that the timely recording of finds proved an ongoing challenge.<note xml:id="ftn65" place="foot" n="65">
                        <p> The principals of the first season were James L. Starkey, Arthur E. R. Boak, Orlando W. (“Pip”) Qualley, and Samuel Yeivin: see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95948">Boak and Peterson 1931</ref>: 1. For the difficulties in record-keeping, see, for example, Orlando W. Qualley to Clara Petra Wollan, (15 Feb. 1925): “Yeivin had to start his plan all over again because some of the measurements were wrong.” Cf. the more expansive remarks of Orlando W. Qualley to Clara Petra Wollan (11 Feb. 1925): “… we had about the worst sandstorm of the year today. Starkey and I gave up recording on the Kom at lunch time and did some filing and cleaning at the house this afternoon. We didn’t have room to take in any more stuff until some was cleared away so it all fitted in well. <emph rend="bold">From now on we are going to try to file and check each night the stuff we record in the field. Otherwise we shall not be able to keep up with the game.</emph> I can see that we shall be busier and busier as the season progresses” (my emphasis).</p>
                     </note> At least one other papyrus whose field number suggests a ‘surface find’ certainly had a more precise archaeological context that was not captured in the record of objects.<note xml:id="ftn66" place="foot" n="66">
                        <p> P.Mich. inv. 2754 (<ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/59082">TM 59082</ref>) bears the field number ‘24-X-west side’ in the dig’s record of excavated objects, but cf. the account of its discovery in Orlando W. Qualley to Clara Petra Wollan, (3 Dec. 1924): “Yesterday we had our first find of any consequence… <emph rend="bold">While digging the bricks from the walls of a room</emph> on the side of the mound a nice bit of papyri turned up. It’s about the size of this page and is written on both sides but in different hands…” (my emphasis). Qualley’s subsequent letter of 9 December makes clear that the papyrus whose discovery he reported is inv. 2754 (Alcidamas’ <emph rend="italics">On Homer</emph>). If it was found while excavating the walls of a room, it was no random surface find and the record of objects is (for whatever reason) faulty.</p>
                     </note> But the origin of these papyri can be pinpointed no more precisely than to say that they originated in Area A, on the west side of the <emph rend="italics">kôm</emph>’s monumental crater.<anchor xml:id="Ref176355388"/>

Unlike the first two surface finds, the case of this papyrus is all the more interesting because the Michigan collection includes additional fragments of it that were acquired via two separate purchases on the Egyptian antiquities market, made several years apart. P.Mich. inv. 2 was purchased from Maurice Nahman by Kelsey and Grenfell in February 1920 and became one of the cornerstones of the collection,<note xml:id="ftn71" place="foot" n="71">
                        <p> For Grenfell and Kelsey’s initial inspection of Nahman’s papyri on 21 February 1920, see Todd Hickey’s forthcoming introduction to P.Mich.Cent.</p>
                     </note> while P.Mich. inv. 3160 originated in a lot purchased from Dr. Kondilios in July 1925.<note xml:id="ftn72" place="foot" n="72">
                        <p> This lot included P.Mich. inv. 3101–3192, a group notable for the many Zenon papyri among them, of which Kondilios was a notorious source.</p>
                     </note> It is unclear whether the two purchased fragments were unearthed together but took different paths to market, or whether they were uncovered on separate occasions (as the five-year gap in acquisition might imply).<note xml:id="ftn73" place="foot" n="73">

Structure 5006 is a courtyard in the so-called ‘middle level’ of Area A (on the northwest side of the <emph rend="italics">kôm</emph>),<note xml:id="ftn77" place="foot" n="77">
                        <p> The location of this structure in Area A is confirmed by the third plan drafted by Yeivin, titled ‘Karanis (Kom Aushim): Area A, Second Layer’, which is reproduced in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97264">Sears 2012</ref>: 174.

                         <p> The handwritten notebooks in which excavated objects were recorded in the first season include the names of the Egyptian excavators who dug each context, information that was lost when the notebooks were typed and, eventually, entered into a spreadsheet. For these notebooks, see Box 7, Karanis Excavation Records, Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, University of Michigan. The name is written in abbreviated form (Ah Ostman) on the page for 5006/E2 (see <ref target="#fig35">Figure 35</ref>), but on the third page for 5006/A, it is written in full. The date derives from Orlando W. Qualley to Clara Petra Wollan (18 March 1925), which mentions the discovery of a batch of papyri, one of which involved the selection of ephebes – evidently P.Mich. inv. 2985 (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/14017">SB 4 7427</ref>), which also has the field number 24-5006E<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>-A. See also Qualley’s letters of 10 and 11 March.

                  <p xml:id="p41">The archaeological context of a fragment dating to the first or second century in the top layer of the site is, in a word, problematic. The situation is further complicated by the excavation’s record of objects, which notes that the papyrus was excavated “4'6" from floor in N.E. corner from filling.” Not only was the papyrus uncovered from a much later level of the site than archaeology would predict, in other words, but the circumstances of its excavation compound the difficulty. The explanation for the level and curious deposition height is doubtless to be found in the nearby activities of the sebakhin, which effectively turned the archaeological record upside down: as they dug the <emph rend="italics">kôm</emph> for the purpose of accumulating heaps of sebakh, newer material (from the site’s upper layer) ended up at the bottom of a heap, atop which older material (from lower layers) was accumulated. I suggest that one such heap was conglomerated atop Granary 169, from the area of sebakh-extraction to the immediate south.<note xml:id="ftn88" place="foot" n="88">

                  <p>The papyrus was dated by its editors to the third century, probably based on assumptions about the archaeology (and, in particular, the date of the B level), as well as the fact that a late second or third-century customs house receipt originates in the same context (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/14128">SB 6 9234</ref>; 29-B197A-G).

Epsilon is typically drawn in two strokes, with the second concluding in a broad extension to the right.  Bilinearity is observed but for a tall iota and the hasta of rho, a letter which is also notable for its minuscule bubble.

                     </note> Over forty years elapsed between the purchase of the Aberdeen fragment and the discovery of several others, via excavation. The papyrus’ other remarkable feature involves the excavation records. The fragments of inv. 6239 were entered into the record of objects under two separate field numbers: 32-C63N-A and 32-219*-M. The circumstances underlying that compound field number are not made clear in the excavation data. Initially, I interpreted it as an indication of some sort of archaeological uncertainty, such as a findspot that lay in between two contexts.<note xml:id="ftn104" place="foot" n="104">

                     </note> Further examination disproved this hypothesis: House 219, from the top layer, is situated in the north-east corner of the south-western quadrant of grid square F11, while Room C63N, from the third layer, lies on the eastern side of the north-western quadrant of grid square F11.<note xml:id="ftn105" place="foot" n="105">

                     </note> Even though the asterisk in the field number 32-219*-M probably indicates that the papyrus was found beneath the floor level of this structure, it could not have been confused for any part of Room C63N because the two contexts do not at all overlap. Nor can we suppose that 219 is a clerical error of some sort: the structure directly above C63N in the top layer is House 235, and the finds from both House 219 and House 235 included papyri.<note xml:id="ftn106" place="foot" n="106">

                  <p xml:id="p50">The likelier explanation is that the various fragments of inv. 6239 came to light separately, in the two different findspots, and that they were assigned the same inventory number because they were promptly identified as belonging to one and the same bookroll. It is unusual for separately excavated fragments to be inventoried together immediately – I know of no other examples in the excavation data – but both finds emerged during the same excavation season in relative proximity to one another, and both the text in question and the hand (see further, <ref target="#p51">below</ref>) are recognizable enough. Given that the acquisition of the Aberdeen fragment occurred decades before the Michigan excavation, the ‘wandering’ of the excavated fragments is  easily explained by the previous disturbance of the archaeological record in this area of Karanis.<note xml:id="ftn108" place="foot" n="108">

                     </note> Wandering may have also occurred in antiquity, but modern disturbance better explains why one excavated fragment was found below floor-level of a top layer structure, another in a context belonging to the third layer, meters below, and how another made its way to market. </p>

The letters are drawn carefully, and the pen lifted consistently to make letters in separate strokes: alpha and epsilon, in particular, are in three distinct movements. Finials adorn eta, kappa, alpha, nu, and delta, and there is ample evidence of shading of strokes, with shadows along the vertical and finer hairstrokes along the horizontal axis. The middle element of omega leans backward; omicron is left slightly open at the top, as is the left side of rho’s bubble. Andorlini notes a number of parallels in assigning a date in the first or, more probably, the second century, and I concur with her judgment.<note xml:id="ftn109" place="foot" n="109">

               <head>Conclusions</head>
               <p xml:id="p52">This article has undertaken a reassessment of published Homeric papyri from Karanis on parallel (but independent) tracks, analyzing them from the perspectives of papyrology and archaeology, respectively. By considering the papyri on their own terms, it has attempted to identify new palaeographical parallels for the assignment of a date, however tentative (if not problematic) such comparisons necessarily are as regards literary papyri. On the basis of the University of Michigan’s archival maps, photographs (and captions), and associated finds in the record of objects – including ceramics – it has also attempted to outline a modest picture of their ancient contexts, as well as to reconstruct the circumstances of their deposition and persistence in the archaeological record. </p>
               <p xml:id="p53">A survey of the papyri that have been examined in the course of this article clusters them in various ways. In some cases, virtually nothing can be gleaned from the interrogation of archival material or archaeological legacy data beyond the basic information recorded in an object’s field number: the year of excavation, archaeological level, structure (and subdivision) of excavation, and a serialized itemization. For the surface finds of the first season (Nos. <ref target="#no17">17</ref>, <ref target="#no18">18</ref>, and <ref target="#no19">19</ref>), for example, virtually no archaeological data can be brought to bear on a papyrological analysis, but belonging to the same cluster are texts for which the legacy data is insufficient to pinpoint even the particular structural subdivision of excavation (Nos. <ref target="#no2">2–6</ref>, <ref target="#no9">9–10</ref>, <ref target="#no12">12</ref>, <ref target="#no15">15</ref>, <ref target="#no24">24</ref>). The texts of this most problematic group, notably, include papyri acquired via purchase on the antiquities market: field numbers provide somewhat more precise archaeological data than the reports accompanying purchased papyri, but neither by any means permits a rigorous contextualization. In general, there is very little overlap (or possibility thereof) between papyrological and archaeological analyses.</p>
               <p xml:id="p54">In precious few cases, examination of archival material sheds additional light on a text’s context. The collation of photographs, maps, and other descriptions can illustrate features of Karanis’ archaeology: not only are the findspots of Nos. <ref target="#no1">1</ref>, <ref target="#no7">7</ref>, <ref target="#no8">8</ref>, <ref target="#no11">11</ref>, <ref target="#no16">16</ref>, <ref target="#no20">20</ref> identified, but they can also be pinpointed, visualized, or otherwise analyzed. It is worth pointing out that Vault B17F, Room B9Y, and Vault 5006-E<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> all appear to be either storage facilities or immediately adjacent to storage facilities: the accumulation of large numbers of diverse papyri in two of those locations – and also in Courtyard B12L (outside, in the open air) – is suggestive of dumping. </p>
               <p xml:id="p55">A third cluster includes papyri from contexts that the excavation’s record of objects indicates yielded cognate finds. For these, comparison or collation of the cognate finds’ testimony with that of an individual papyrus is theoretically possible, but – a century later – only a few of the cognate object types are particularly illuminating. Papyri, ostraca, numismatics, and selected ceramics are dateable, but where comparison is possible, the results are often anomalous. Although it happened more than once at Karanis that papyri and ostraca came to light in batches, for example, examination of the assemblages to which Nos. <ref target="#no7">7</ref>, <ref target="#no8">8</ref>, <ref target="#no13">13</ref>, <ref target="#no14">14</ref>, and <ref target="#no20">20</ref> belong indicates that such batches are heterogeneous in terms of date or content. One cannot assume that the texts have a single, common origin; it appears, rather, that the material is diverse, potentially from multiple sources, and that assemblages were accumulated or dumped over decades, if not centuries, of time. Numismatics are no more reliable: they accompany Homeric papyri only rarely at Karanis and add little to the conversation – the extreme cases of the coins accompanying <ref target="#no22">No. 22</ref> and in the vicinity of <ref target="#no23">No. 23</ref> are revealing on a different front. </p>
               <p xml:id="p56">The ceramics excavated at Karanis would provide the most promising basis for comparison, but the legacy data reflects the limitations of ceramology in the early twentieth century and defies a sophisticated typological analysis. Only in a few special cases of Late Roman African Red Slip fine wares can dateable types be confidently identified within the record of objects. Nonetheless, even a small sample is sufficient to demonstrate how complicated the archaeology of a given context can be; excavation discovered a papyrus from the late-second or early third century (<ref target="#no23">No. 23</ref>) in the same room as African Red Slip pottery from the fourth or fifth centuries, which makes for a transparent chronological anomaly. A structure yielding fine ware pottery of similarly later vintage was located not far from another second or early third-century papyrus (<ref target="#no20">No. 20</ref>). It has long been clear that the Michigan team’s approach to stratigraphy was imperfect,<note xml:id="ftn110" place="foot" n="110">
                     <p> See, e.g., <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/85713">Landvatter 2014</ref> and <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/86131">Landvatter 2016</ref>.</p>
                  </note> but these anomalies put in stark contrast how structures and neighborhoods could be occupied for centuries. The ceramic evidence is consistent with the excavation’s analysis of how houses were inhabited and modified over long periods of time, but is at odds with the dates assigned by the Michigan team to particular levels. Pottery adds to the growing consensus that Karanis’ decline came centuries later than the fourth and early fifth century date suggested by the papyri.<note xml:id="ftn111" place="foot" n="111">
                     <p> So, most recently, <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97276">Motta et al. 2024</ref>, contra (most notably) <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95948">Boak and Peterson 1931</ref>: 5.</p>

               </p>
               <p xml:id="p57">Archaeological anomalies can involve excavated objects or more general problems stemming from the legacy data, which brings me to the final cluster of texts. The twofold field-number assigned to <ref target="#no25">No. 25</ref>, for example, suggests some sort of disturbance of the archaeological record, which scattered fragments of a single ancient book across different contexts. That disturbance is consistent with the acquisition, decades earlier, of an additional fragment of the same bookroll. Other contexts yielded finds whose archaeology is incompatible with the papyrological testimony. When a fourth-century codex fragment (<ref target="#no22">No. 22</ref>) is uncovered in the same context as Ptolemaic-era coinage, or when the excavation records themselves indicate that a late-first or early-second century papyrus was found several feet above the floor level of a top-layer structure (<ref target="#no21">No. 21</ref>), one must tread carefully. The former case is important for illustrating the need to conduct papyrological and archaeological analyses separately: it seems that a third-century date was assigned to the papyrus initially not on palaeographical grounds, but because of mistaken assumptions about the B layer in which it was excavated as well as the presence of a late second or third-century receipt in the same context. But the palaeography points rather decisively to the fourth century, and the archaeology is indicative of much confusion both in the analysis of layers – between B and C layer – as well as in the broad chronological range of the finds. The nearby disturbance of the archaeological record, evident on excavation maps, is likely to blame. In the latter case, the available data suggests a similar explanation: because the excavation maps indicate that the structure in question was adjacent to the crater dug by the sebakhin, it seems that their activities were effectively turning the archaeological record upside-down in this location, depositing an early papyrus from a deeper archaeological level atop material from higher, later periods. One should not be tempted to assign a later date to the papyrus by invoking its anomalous archaeology. The challenge, rather, is reconstructing how it may have ended up in the context of its excavation.</p>
               <p xml:id="p58">The Homeric papyri from Karanis reveal how valuable a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach to archival material and legacy data can be – not only for our understanding of the history of both the site and its ancient readers, but also for limiting the kinds of inferences scholarship might otherwise be tempted to draw. Papyrology has a tendency to begin with the text and to proceed from there in various directions, while archaeology is wont to construct its picture from the ground up – beginning with the artifact and the context of its discovery. The two approaches can complement and reinforce one another, but equally important are anomalies or divergences in the results. Archaeology can problematize how we know what we think we know about papyri – or, indeed, whether we know it at all – and some sensitivity to the evidence’s fragility limits the scholarly impulse to extrapolate and to synthesize information in bold ways. Just because papyri are precious in the eyes of modern academics does not mean that they were handled with similar care and deliberation in antiquity, or that their ancient contexts are easily reconstructed.</p>
