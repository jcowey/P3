### Comparable online journals
An online journal which offers a model I, personally, like is: https://github.com/i-d-e.

Under https://github.com/i-d-e/ride the volumes are listed. 
 * Within each volume https://github.com/i-d-e/ride/tree/master/issues/issue04
 * one can view each article: https://github.com/i-d-e/ride/tree/master/issues/issue04/welschergast
 * or https://github.com/i-d-e/ride/tree/master/issues/issue09/papyri-info, for which the full tei.xml of the file is visible:
   * https://github.com/i-d-e/ride/blob/master/issues/issue09/papyri-info/papyri-info-tei.xml

Also nicely done is **Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy**: https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198749516.001.0001
  * https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198749516.003.0008
    * note the presence of both Abstract and Keywords
      * One cannot refer to individual pages nor to individual paragraphs.
      * Linking to individual footnotes is possible, e.g. [ftn10](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198749516.001.0001/acprof-9780198749516-chapter-8#acprof-9780198749516-chapter-8-note-10)
