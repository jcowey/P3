What do we want to be able to reference / provide a link for?

 * footnotes
   * https://books.openedition.org/momeditions/8572#ftn12 (when there you do not see that you are there, you have to scroll down to see footnote 12)
   * https://books.openedition.org/momeditions/8572#bodyftn12 (same as above, but in both cases the footnote number is made clear)
     * or
   * http://www.zfdg.de/2020_005#fn23
 * one or more paragraphs in the running text of the article, e.g.:
   * http://www.zfdg.de/2020_005#pid14  (when there you do not see that you are there, you have to scroll down and assume that the paragraph 
   starting - "Another example relates to the choice issue raised by Dekker ..." is paragraph 14)
   * http://www.zfdg.de/2020_005#pid12_#pid14 (not possible, not sure how it might be expressed, but would potentially be very useful)
 * each individual separate "edition" i.e. text 1, text 2, text 3, text 4 in 
the BASP article by Claytor
 * line commentaries (this could be done by ref, but the path is not clear)
 * each translation
 * each correction to an edited text
