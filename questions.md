What do we want to be able to reference / provide a link for?

 * footnotes
   * https://books.openedition.org/momeditions/8572#ftn12 (when there you do not see that you are there, you have to scroll down to see footnote 12)
   * https://books.openedition.org/momeditions/8572#bodyftn12 (same as above, but in both cases the footnote number is made clear)
     * or
   * http://www.zfdg.de/2020_005#fn23
 * one or more paragraphs in the running text of the article, e.g.:
   * http://www.zfdg.de/2020_005#pid14  (when there you do not see that you are there, you have to scroll down and assume that the paragraph 
   starting - "Another example relates to the choice issue raised by Dekker ..." is paragraph 14)
   * http://www.zfdg.de/2020_005#pid12_#pid14 (not possible, not sure how it might be expressed, but would potentially be very useful)
 * each individual separate "edition" i.e. text 1 (the others likewise) in the BASP article by Claytor
   * https://github.com/hcayless/P3-processing/blob/main/articles/ClaytorSmithWarga_FourPoll_TaxReceiptsTrial-2.xml#L164-L225
   * or at the least to
     * https://github.com/hcayless/P3-processing/blob/main/articles/ClaytorSmithWarga_FourPoll_TaxReceiptsTrial-2.xml#L164-L165
 * line commentaries (this could be done by the `ref tag, but the path is not clear)
 * each translation
 * each correction to an edited text
