# First steps
 - call up https://github.com/hcayless/P3-processing
 - you must be a registered contributor to be able to upload files: for this contact Hugh Cayless and ask him to add you to the list of contributors

## Uploading files
 - click on the folder `sources`
 - make sure that your file is a `.docx` file and has this suffix at the end of the file name.
 - give the file a clear title with author name(s) and simple short title
 - now click on `Add file` (top right hand corner)
 - choose `Upload files`
 - navigate to the file on your computer by clicking on `choose your files` or simply Drag the file
 - make a Commit note and press `Commit changes`
 - it usually takes a good 30 seconds and up to a minute or even a bit longer for the conversion to be completed: you will be informed by github of completion

## Finding XML files
 - from here https://github.com/hcayless/P3-processing click on the folder `articles`
 - there you will find the file with the same name as you gave it (without the suffix `.docx`)

## File was not converted
 - you will see a message that the conversion failed and get an email
 - you can click on the link in that mail to see a report of what went wrong
