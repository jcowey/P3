A few comments on the experiment files so far.

1. O.Berenike 4 in HTML: [Ast, Bagnall, Vanderheyden](https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/pylon/article/view/89358/83988)
   - Here is the PDF in its [original version](https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/pylon/article/view/89358/84248)
     - Each image precedes the transcription directly
   - and once the new floating transformation has been implemented in its [floated version](https://github.com/jcowey/P3/blob/master/pdfs/PDF_improvement_experimentation/p3test_ast_bagnall_berenike_4_text_float_after.pdf)
     - Now the images are placed whenever the system finds a place to put them.
     - In ยง8 the image is embedded in the middle of the paragraph, which is the introduction to O.Berenike 4 512.
     - In ยง12 (the second paragraph of the introduction to O.Berenike 4 513) the image is embedded/floated.
     - After ยง22 the text of O.Berenike 4 514 is interrupted by the image under which line 3 of the text follows.
   
2. Scholia minora to Iliad 1.1-12 in HTML [Lougovaya](https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/pylon/article/view/98180/93353)
   - Here is the PDF in its [original version](https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/pylon/article/view/98180/93354)
   - and once the new floating transformation has been implemented in its [floated version](https://github.com/jcowey/P3/blob/master/pdfs/PDF_improvement_experimentation/p3test_lougovaya_scholia_text_float_after.pdf)
   - The two enhanced images which immediately preceded the edition have now been embedded slightly earlier in the flow of the text in ยง5.
